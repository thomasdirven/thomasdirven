## Some of my projects

This summer I worked 9 weeks as a full stack developer at Volvo Cars Ghent. I made an application that allows to business to configure their own visualizations of the production lines in the Volvo Cars factories. I'm not allowed to share my code but I made a short (and a long) demo video of what I have made there.

This was my first angular project. We had to come up with an idea for an angular app and had to include some extra technologies that were not discussed during our classes. I used the Google Maps and Geocode API as extra's.
